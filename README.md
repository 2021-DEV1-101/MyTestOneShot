# Software Development Books

This short and simple Kata performed using Test Driven Development (TDD) implemented in Java.

## About this Kata

There is a series of books about software development that have been read by a lot of developers who want to improve their development skills. Letâ€™s say an editor, in a gesture of immense generosity to mankind (and to increase sales as well), is willing to set up a pricing model where you can get discounts when you buy these books. The available books are :

* Clean Code (Robert Martin, 2008)
* The Clean Coder (Robert Martin, 2011)
* Clean Architecture (Robert Martin, 2017)
* Test Driven Development by Example (Kent Beck, 2003)
* Working Effectively With Legacy Code (Michael C. Feathers, 2004)

## Technologies

* Java
* SpringBoot

## SetUp

You need to open the IDE and run the tests existing in the `/src/test`.
Those tests are relized with TDD when a tests fails we do a refactor and then we try again to test (and repeat).
